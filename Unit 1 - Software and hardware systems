Computer types - personel computers, servers (used in other than workstations), super computers ( used for huge computations).

Computer consists of 5 functional units 

Input unit - which acepts the coded information from human (keybord, mouse) 

Output unit - (monitor, printer)

Memory unit -  This unit stores programs and data. 

RAM ( random access memory)- A memory in which any location can be reached ina short and fixed amount of time after specifying its address. 

Instruction Cycle = Fetch the instruction - decode the instruction - execute

The central processing unit(CPU) will process the data by moving it between the ALU and registers and performing arithmatic operations. 

Arithematic and logic unit ( Example : Multiplication, Division, or coparison of numbers)

Control unit ( which directs the flow of data among units by sending control signals from one unit to other). 

The information recieved is either stored in the computer's memory for lateer reference or immediately used by the arithmetic and logic unit to perform any operation. 

Bus structures - which cover the designs of communication pathways.
* Data bus which transfer data between components
* Address bus which specifies the memory locations
* Control bus which sends the control signals to manage the data flow within the units.  

The connection between the memory and processor

* The RAM and ROM stores both data and program instructions and connects various units through buses.
* The processor component MAR ( memory address register) reads the adreess of the memory location which should be accessed and sends the memory to the memory unit. 
* MDR ( memory data register) will hold the fetched memory temporarily, this usually acts like a buffer between memory and processor.
* The program counter (PC) stores the address of the upcoming instructions which is to be executed. These processes executes automatically after ecah instruction.
* Instruction register (IR) stores the current instruction running.
* Control unit directs the flow of data between processor and other units
* ALU performs operations.
