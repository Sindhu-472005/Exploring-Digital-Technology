We learnt how to create a directory 

$ mkdir temp
$ mkdir temp/stuff
$ mkdir temp/stuff/things
$ mkdir -p temp/stuff/things/frank/joe/alex/john

These are the different ways to that we can run directories. So mkdir makes directories.

What does it mean to make a directory? 
We all know "folders". They're the same thing. All we did abbove is we created a directories inside directories inside more directories. This is called "path"
"Path" is a set of directions to the computer which tells where computer wants to put something in the three folders or directories and that make up our computer's hard disk.


The first simple command we used is  $pwd
pwd which means "print working directory." It returns the full path of your current directory in the terminal. 


Change Directory (cd) - $ cd temp
Command $ cd temp is used to change the current directory to another directory named temp.

What happens : This command move us into an already existing folder in our current directory. If temp does not exist, we'll get an error.
example :  input = $ pwd
           output = /home/user
           input = $ cd temp
                 = $ pwd
           output = /home/user/temp


List Directory (ls) - $ ls
The $ls command lists out the contents of the directory you are currently in. It shows files, directories.

Command $ls -l is used if we want more detailed output like permissions, size etc.

Command $ls -a is used to include the hidden files.


Remove Directory (rmdir) 
The $rmdir <directory-name> command is used to remove or delete an empty directory.

The $rmdir <file-name> command is used to remove or delete a file within the directory
