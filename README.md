A collection of my notes.


Computer types - personel computers, servers (used in other than workstations), super computers ( used for huge computations).
Computer consists of 5 functional units 
Input unit(which acepts the coded information from human.keybord, mouse)
Output unit (monitor), memory unit, Arithematic and logic unit. control unit ( which directs the flow of data among units).
The information recieved is either stored in the computer's memory for lateer reference or immediately used by the arithmetic and logic unit to perform any operation. 

Bus structures - which cover the designs of communication pathways.
* Data bus which transfer data between components
* Address bus which specifies the memory locations
* Control bus which sends the control signals to manage the data flow within the units.
