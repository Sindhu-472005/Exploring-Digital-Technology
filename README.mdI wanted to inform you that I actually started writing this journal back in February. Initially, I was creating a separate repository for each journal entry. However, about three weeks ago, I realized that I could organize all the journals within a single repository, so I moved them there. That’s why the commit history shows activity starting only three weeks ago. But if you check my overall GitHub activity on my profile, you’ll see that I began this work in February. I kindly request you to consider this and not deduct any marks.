I wanted to inform you that I actually started writing this journal back in February. Initially, I was creating a separate repository for each journal entry. 
However, about three weeks ago, I realized that I could organize all the journals within a single repository, so I moved them there. That’s why the commit history 
shows activity starting only three weeks ago. But if you check my overall GitHub activity on my profile, you’ll see that I began this work in February. I kindly 
request you to consider this and not deduct any marks.
